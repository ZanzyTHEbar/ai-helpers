# AI-Helpers

This repository contains helpers for AI projects. The goal is to provide a set of patterns and strategies that can be used to build AI projects faster and more efficiently. The repository is divided into several sections, each section contains a set of tools that can be used for a specific task. The sections are:

- [RAG Strategies](RAG-strategies.md)
- [GenAI Pipeline](genai-pipeline.md)
- [Costs](costs.md)
- [Advanced Patterns](patterns.drawio)
